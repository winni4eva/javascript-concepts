### Bad Style
Avoid using the increment operator (++). To prevent other programmers second guessing your code try to use the long format.

```
Post Increment
x++
```

```
Pre Increment
++x
```

You need to known the difference of a post increment and preincrement to safely use the operator.
Its very had to debug these when they cause off by one errors.

```
Simpler form
x += 1
```

NB: For no cost by adopting a more rigorous style, many classes of errors can be avoided.

### Classes of Bad Stylists
- Under Educated: More in web development. People writing javascript without any form of formal training.
- Old School: Experienced developers in one language who are forced by circumstance to work on any language where they do not have the same amount 
of experince
- Thrill Seekers: People who learn to use a language because of the quirks that exist in the language
- Exhibitionist: These people will study the language to find any edge cases and intentionally use them. It makes them proud that
nobody else knows what they are doing.

### Performance
- Performance specific code is isually crufty. If the so called performant code doesnt improve performance then remove it. Measure twice cut once.
- Clean code is easier to reason about.
- Premature optimization is the root of all evil. Donald Knuth
- Most of the code has a negligible impact on performance. Only optimize the code that is taking time.
- Algorithm replacement is vastly more effective than code fiddling.
